# Run locally

Prerequisite : Node v12.13 or higher

Clone the project to your local machine and run 
### `npm install` from the project root to install all the required dependencies.

To start the app, you can run:

### `npm start`

in the project directory

Alternatively you can also use `yarn` instead of `npm`.

App responsiveness can be checked using Toggle device toolbar from chrome dev tools. Breakpoints are not detected automatically, so you'll need to refresh the page, once view port size is changed through toolbar.
